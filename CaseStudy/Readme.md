# Receiver
- The receiver is a dual conversion super heterodyne. The incoming signal frequency is down converted twice to frequency of 455KHz or 10.7MHMz with the help of mixer and IF amplifier stages. 
- The signal is then demodulated deemphasized and filtered and given to loud speaker.
# LCD
- A liquid crystal display is the most common display type among mobile phones because of its low power consumption and good image quality. 
- They are generally easy to read, even under direct sunlight. 
# SPK
- The Smartphone Production Kit enables speakers to pre-record keynote presentations or contribute and interact live to online events through NOMOBO's remote control room (MCR).
# CAMERA
- Every lens in a  camera is coupled with a sensor. The sensor records the light coming in from the lens in digital format, just like any other digital camera. Like lenses, the sensors in a smartphone camera are tiny. 
- This is another reason why smartphone cameras don't have as shallow a depth of field.
# MIC
- Cell phones use tiny electret condenser or MEMS microphones. These mics require very little power to function, which is easily supplied by the cell phone battery.
# CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR
- A crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit that uses a piezoelectric resonator, a crystal, as its frequency-determining element. 
- Crystal is the common term used in electronics for the frequency-determining component, a wafer of quartz crystal or ceramic with electrodes connected to it.
# FLASH
- A button on a smart phone that takes the place of pressing and quickly letting go of the switch hook.
- It is used for various functions, including calling the attendant, call waiting, call transfer, conferencing and placing a line on hold.
# TRANSCEIVER
- A transceiver is a combination tranceiver in a single package.
- In wireless communication devices, like smartphones and cordless telephones, the transceiver is built into the mobile device.
# WLAN
-  It provides short-range wireless high-speed data connections between mobile data devices (such as laptops, PDAs or phones) and nearby Wi-Fi access points (special hardware connected to a wired network).
# GPS
- Gps is a radio navigation system. It uses radio waves between satellites and a receiver inside your phone to provide location and time information to any software that needs to use it.
- The phone's GPS receiver uses the data from these signals to triangulate where you are and what time it is.
# SIM
- Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is . SIM cards link a certain account to a certain phone.
- They tell the phone network company which account is joined up to which person's phone. Phone network companies usually call customers “subscribers”.
- These towers allow us to make phone calls.
# MICROCONTROLLER
- A microcontroller is embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device.
- It does this by interpreting data it receives from its I/O peripherals using its central processor.
