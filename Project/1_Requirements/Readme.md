# 1 About the Smart Parking System
# 1.1 Description
- This system help in organizing the parking lot and helps the driver to reach their parking spots easily as they known which space is vacant. The parking space can be detected using an Infrared sensor that connects to the ESP12-E module that was programmed through Arduino IDE. Users can access parking space information using a smart phone via an application. The system can work with the purpose of the research appropriately. 
# 1.2 Identifying features
-	Identification of free parking spots and providing that information to users on the road.
-	By sensors improved enforcement methods to ensure there are no significantly overstaying vehicles.
-	On-street and off-street parking characteristics were analyzed considering the parking statistics
-	It gives an aggregate measure of how effectively the parking space is utilized.
# 1.3 State of art
- This project makes use of IR sensor, ultrasonic sensors, Here use IR sensor is to get information about parking slots and ultrasonic sensor is to get the presence of car then all the inputs is uploaded to the board. The availability of parking slot indicating by glowing LED. If green LED glows it’s indicated that slot is free that is booked by someone else it turns off it indicates that parking slot is already filled and if red LED glows then it’s indicates that slot is free and still no one is booked.
