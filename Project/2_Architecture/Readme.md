# 3.2 SENSORS
#	IR Sensor
 IR sensor is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. Usually, in infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation. 
 These types of radiations are invisible to our eyes, but infrared sensor can detect these radiations. The emitter is simply an IR LED (Light Emitting Diode) and the detector is simply an IR photodiode . 
 Photodiode is sensitive to IR light of the same wavelength which is emitted by the IR LED. When IR light falls on the photodiode, the resistances and the output voltages will change in proportion to the magnitude of the IR light received.

- LCD Display:
	Displays each and every value we enter in our keypad along with Temperature.
# 3.4 MICRO CONTROLLER 
-	MicroController:
Microcontroller is used to convert the position signal from the image processing done on the PC to control signals to move the motors using the IK of the robot. The proposed microcontroller used in the research is the commercial well known Arduino board. 
An Arduino is a single-board microcontroller and a software suite for programming. It is designed for an Atmel AVR processor and features on-board I/O support. Arduino Mega microcontroller board is based on the ATmega1280. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal Fig. 2-3 Torque curve of (260 oz.in) stepper and (240 oz.in) servo. oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.
 It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller
# 3.5 SUBSYSTEM & OTHERS
- Servo Motor Unit:
  A servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servo motor. 
  It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism. If motor is used is DC powered then it is called DC servo motor, and if it is AC powered motor then it is called AC servo motor.
