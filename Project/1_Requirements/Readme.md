# 1 About the Smart Parking System
# 1.1 Abstract
- This system help in organizing the parking lot and helps the driver to reach their parking spots easily as they known which space is vacant. The parking space can be detected using an Infrared sensor that connects to the ESP12-E module that was programmed through Arduino IDE. Users can access parking space information using a smart phone via an application. The system can work with the purpose of the research appropriately. 
# 1.2 Identifying features
-	Identification of free parking spots and providing that information to users on the road.
-	By sensors improved enforcement methods to ensure there are no significantly overstaying vehicles.
-	On-street and off-street parking characteristics were analyzed considering the parking statistics
-	It gives an aggregate measure of how effectively the parking space is utilized.
# 1.3 State of art
- This project makes use of IR sensor, ultrasonic sensors, Here use IR sensor is to get information about parking slots and ultrasonic sensor is to get the presence of car then all the inputs is uploaded to the board. The availability of parking slot indicating by glowing LED. If green LED glows it’s indicated that slot is free that is booked by someone else it turns off it indicates that parking slot is already filled and if red LED glows then it’s indicates that slot is free and still no one is booked.
# 4Ws and 1H
# What
Verifying the account details of user

# WHEN
when user need parking lot

# WHERE
In there nearest places 

# WHO
People who need to order parking lot

# HOW
Login and check the vaccancy

# High Level Requirements
| ID | High Level Requirements |
|---------- | --------------- |
| HL1 | System should control vaccancy of parking lot |
| HL2 | There should be interface |
| HL3 | Motorspeed is controlled |
| HL4 | System should detect the number of vehicles and vacancy |

# Low Level Requirements
| ID | Low Level Requirements |
|---------- | --------------- |
| HL1 | Based on the requirement of user vaccancy should be known |
| HL2 | Based on the no of vehicle vaccancy can be determined |
| HL3 | If the vechile is present the light should be on |
| HL4 | Number of vechile present displayed on screen |

# Best Method followed
- Drivers find a free parking space faster, which reduces congestion and various other negative externalities.
- The smart parking system with guidance to a free parking space can improve the traffic situation in cities.
- Providing better control for consumers, businesses, and law enforcement representatives
