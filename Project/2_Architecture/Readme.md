# 1.2 Microcontroller(ATmega328)

ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-Pin AVR Microcontroller, manufactured by Microchip, follows RISC Architecture and has a flash-type program memory of 32KB.
It has an EEPROM memory of 1KB and its SRAM memory is 2KB. 
Its excellent features include cost-efficiency, low power dissipation, programming lock for security purposes, real timer counter with separate oscillator.

# 1.3 Sensors

- Potentiometer(Air Sensor-MQ135)  

A potentiometer assumed as air quality sensor measures the quality of the airquality in percentage 
Air quality sensors are devices used to detect contaminants in the air. This includes particulates, pollutants and noxious gases that may be harmful to human health. 
It detect gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide by measuring the absorption of infrared light.

- Switch(Oxygen sensor)
A Switch assumed as oxygen sensor measures the percentage of O2
An oxygen sensor is an electronic device that measures the proportion of oxygen (O2) in the gas or liquid being analysed.

# 1.4 Actuators

- LCD Display  

A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device.
It uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.

- LED  

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. 
Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.

- Resister 

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.
# 1.5 Other
- Voltage Source
A voltage source is a two-terminal device which can maintain a fixed voltage. An ideal voltage source can maintain the fixed voltage independent of the load resistance or the output current.
