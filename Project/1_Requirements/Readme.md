# 1 About the  Smart Airquality Monitoring System
# 1.1 Abstract
- This project is an Smart  Airquality Monitoring System , which will be detect the amount of pollutants present  in the air of the  environment. If we know the amount of pollutants present in the air, then precaution can be taken to minimize the level of pollution in the air
# 1.2 Identifying features
-	The main feature of this project is:
-	The LCD will display the percentage of Carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air
-	The LED will glow to indicate when air quality is pure. 
-	The user will get to know easily about the quality of air they are sourrounded by and take precautions for there safety.
-	The cost of sensor used in project is low.
# 1.3 State of art
- This project makes use of Potentiometer assumed as gas sensors,switch 2 as lambda sensors for sensing oxygen.The LCD diplays the percentage of CO2 and O2 present in the gas. 
-  By combining all these components a final system  is made called as S.A.M.S. As the technology is increasing rapidly these kind of system are very useful in our daily          lives.

# High Level Requirements
| ID | High Level Requirements |
|---------- | --------------- |
| HLR1 | System shall measure the quantity of O2 and CO2 |
| HLR2 | There should be interface |
| HLR3 | Potentiometer shall be controlled |
| HLR4 | System shall detect the air is pure or not |

# Low Level Requirements
| ID | Low Level Requirements |
|---------- | --------------- |
| LLR1 | Based on the requirement of user quantity of pollutants can be known |
| LLR2 | Based on the percentage of O2 airquality  can be determined |
| LLR3 | If the Air quality is pure the LED shall be on |
| LLR4 | Percentage of gas present in air shall displayed on screen |
