# 1 About the  Smart Airquality Monitoring System
# 1.1 Abstract
- Smart  monitoring is the project which will be helpful in preventing water from wasting due to overflow and water shortage in the tank. This will help in industries where everything is automated and where water is used as a main element for production and manufacturing.
# 1.2 Identifying features
-	Identification of free parking spots and providing that information to users on the road.
-	By sensors improved enforcement methods to ensure there are no significantly overstaying vehi
-	On-street and off-street parking characteristics were analyzed considering the parking statistics
-	It gives an aggregate measure of how effectively the parking space is utilized.
# 1.3 State of art
- This project makes use of IR sensor, ultrasonic sensors, Here use IR sensor is to get information about parking slots and ultrasonic sensor is to get the presence of car then all the inputs is uploaded to the board. The availability of parking slot indicating by glowing LED. If green LED glows it’s indicated that slot is free that is booked by someone else it turns off it indicates that parking slot is already filled and if red LED glows then it’s indicates that slot is free and still no one is booked.

# High Level Requirements
| ID | High Level Requirements |
|---------- | --------------- |
| HL1 | System should control vaccancy of parking lot |
| HL2 | There should be interface |
| HL3 | Motorspeed is controlled |
| HL4 | System should detect the number of vehicles and vacancy |

# Low Level Requirements
| ID | Low Level Requirements |
|---------- | --------------- |
| HL1 | Based on the requirement of user vaccancy should be known |
| HL2 | Based on the no of vehicle vaccancy can be determined |
| HL3 | If the vechile is present the light should be on |
| HL4 | Number of vechile present displayed on screen |

# Best Method followed
- Drivers find a free parking space faster, which reduces congestion and various other negative externalities.
- The smart parking system with guidance to a free parking space can improve the traffic situation in cities.
- Providing better control for consumers, businesses, and law enforcement representatives
