# Case Study 1: Smart Phone

# Receiver
- The receiver is a dual conversion super heterodyne. The incoming signal frequency is down converted twice to frequency of 455KHz or 10.7MHMz with the help of mixer and IF amplifier stages. 
- The signal is then demodulated deemphasized and filtered and given to loud speaker.
# LCD
- A liquid crystal display is the most common display type among mobile phones because of its low power consumption and good image quality. 
- They are generally easy to read, even under direct sunlight. 
# SPK
- The Smartphone Production Kit enables speakers to pre-record keynote presentations or contribute and interact live to online events through NOMOBO's remote control room (MCR).
# Camera
- Every lens in a  camera is coupled with a sensor. The sensor records the light coming in from the lens in digital format, just like any other digital camera. Like lenses, the sensors in a smartphone camera are tiny. 
- This is another reason why smartphone cameras don't have as shallow a depth of field.
# MIC
- Cell phones use tiny electret condenser or MEMS microphones. These mics require very little power to function, which is easily supplied by the cell phone battery.
# Crystal Oscillator
- A crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit that uses a piezoelectric resonator, a crystal, as its frequency-determining element. 
- Crystal is the common term used in electronics for the frequency-determining component, a wafer of quartz crystal or ceramic with electrodes connected to it.
# Flash
- A button on a smart phone that takes the place of pressing and quickly letting go of the switch hook.
- It is used for various functions, including calling the attendant, call waiting, call transfer, conferencing and placing a line on hold.
# Transceiver
- A transceiver is a combination tranceiver in a single package.
- In wireless communication devices, like smartphones and cordless telephones, the transceiver is built into the mobile device.
# WLAN
-  It provides short-range wireless high-speed data connections between mobile data devices (such as laptops, PDAs or phones) and nearby Wi-Fi access points (special hardware connected to a wired network).
# GPS
- Gps is a radio navigation system. It uses radio waves between satellites and a receiver inside your phone to provide location and time information to any software that needs to use it.
- The phone's GPS receiver uses the data from these signals to triangulate where you are and what time it is.
# SIM
- Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is . SIM cards link a certain account to a certain phone.
- They tell the phone network company which account is joined up to which person's phone. Phone network companies usually call customers “subscribers”.
- These towers allow us to make phone calls.
# Microcontroller
- A microcontroller is embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device.
- It does this by interpreting data it receives from its I/O peripherals using its central processor.
# Case study 2:REFRIGERATOR

# Receiver
- It is a storage vessel designed to hold excess refrigerant which is not in circulation. Refrigeration systems exposed to varying heat loads, or systems utilizing a condenser flooding valve to maintain a minimum head pressure during low ambient temperatures will need a receiver to store excess refrigerant.
# Display
- It is used display food stuffs that require temperature control to retain freshness.
# Keypad
- This is used to take the input of refrigerator temperature or child lock the system.
# Air Temperature Sensor
- It senses the temperature inside the refrigerator and sends information to the electronic control.
# Moisture Sensor
- It measures the ambient humidity and uses that measurement to heat the external surface of the refrigerator only when it is required to prevent condensation from forming.
# Door Open sensor
- As soon as the door is opened it will start emittting a quiet beep every 10 seconds. It is quiet but adequate as a gentle reminder while you fiddle with the stuff in the freezer. 
- At 60 second, it will give a short loud alarm.
# Water/Ice Dispensor
- Placing the dispenser within the fridge prevents water spills on the refrigerator surface.
# Compressor
- Compressor is to compress low-pressure refrigerant vapour to high-pressure vapour.
# FAN
- It pulls air across the evaporator coil, cooling it, and then pushes the air through the freezer and refrigerator.
# Microcontroller
- A microcontroller is embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device.
- It does this by interpreting data it receives from its I/O peripherals using its central processor.
